### Tableau Works

Welcome to my tableau_works repository! Here, I've showcased two of the many Tableau projects I've worked on. These projects represent my passion for data visualization and my interest in hiking and climate analysis.

# Featured Projects
1. Columbia River Gorge Hikes

I created this project as an avid hiker to help plan my hikes in the Columbia River Gorge. The dashboard allows users to explore hiking attributes such as trail difficulty, elevation gain, distance, and more. It's a practical tool for anyone looking to make informed decisions about their outdoor adventures in this beautiful region.

2. Nepal Climate Analysis

As a concerned Nepalese, I wanted to understand how Nepal's climate is changing over the years. This project comprehensively analyzes Nepal's climate data from the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) POWER Project, covering multiple parameters across different regions. It's a deep dive into the environmental shifts occurring in my home country.

# About These Projects

These projects are part of my weekend explorations into data visualization. I enjoy using Tableau to create meaningful, insightful dashboards that address real-world interests and concerns. Some of these projects are also published on Tableau Public, where they are accessible to a broader audience.
