### Nepal Climate Analysis Dashboard

This project provides an in-depth analysis of Nepal's climate using data sourced from the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) POWER Project. The dataset comprises climate data collected from 93 weather stations across 62 districts in Nepal, offering a comprehensive view of the region's meteorological patterns.
Dataset Overview

The data used in this analysis was extracted using NASA's POWER Access API, funded by the NASA Earth Science/Applied Science Program. The dataset includes daily records for various climate parameters, each associated with a specific district in Nepal.
# Key Parameters:

  - Date: The specific date of the climate data record.
  - District: The district in Nepal where the data was recorded (62 districts in total).
  - Latitude and Longitude: Geographical coordinates of the district's location.
  - Precip: Daily precipitation, measured in millimeters per day (mm/day).
  - Pressure: Surface atmospheric pressure, measured in kilopascals (kPa).
  - Humidity_2m: Specific humidity at 2 meters above ground level (g/kg).
  - RH_2m: Relative humidity at 2 meters above ground level (%).
  - Temp_2m: Temperature at 2 meters above ground level (°C).
  - WetBulbTemp_2m: Wet bulb temperature at 2 meters above ground level (°C).
  - MaxTemp_2m: Maximum temperature at 2 meters above ground level (°C).
  - MinTemp_2m: Minimum temperature at 2 meters above ground level (°C).
  - TempRange_2m: Temperature range at 2 meters above ground level (°C).
  - EarthSkinTemp: Surface temperature of the Earth (°C).
  - WindSpeed_10m: Wind speed at 10 meters above ground level (m/s).
  - MaxWindSpeed_10m: Maximum wind speed at 10 meters above ground level (m/s).
  - MinWindSpeed_10m: Minimum wind speed at 10 meters above ground level (m/s).
  - WindSpeedRange_10m: Wind speed range at 10 meters above ground level (m/s).
  - WindSpeed_50m: Wind speed at 50 meters above ground level (m/s).
  - MaxWindSpeed_50m: Maximum wind speed at 50 meters above ground level (m/s).
  - MinWindSpeed_50m: Minimum wind speed at 50 meters above ground level (m/s).
  - WindSpeedRange_50m: Wind speed range at 50 meters above ground level (m/s).

This rich dataset provides a solid foundation for climate research and analysis across Nepal’s diverse regions.

## Tableau Dashboard Features

The interactive Tableau dashboard created for this project allows users to explore and analyze Nepal's climate data through several key features:

  - Attribute Selection: Users can choose different climate parameters to visualize, with options to display data by year or month.
  - Interactive Map: The dashboard features an interactive map highlighting all 62 districts in Nepal. Users can click on any district to view localized climate data.
  - Metric Comparison: The dashboard enables the comparison of two selected metrics, allowing users to dynamically change the metrics for customized analysis.
  - Yearly Graphs with Forecasting: The dashboard includes yearly trend graphs for selected attributes, with projections extending to 2023 to predict future climate trends.

## How to Use the Dashboard

  - Choose Attributes: Utilize the drop-down menus to select specific climate parameters for detailed analysis.
  - Interact with the Map: Click on districts within the interactive map to view climate data specific to that region.
  - Compare Metrics: Use the comparison tool to analyze relationships between different climate parameters.
  - View Projections: Switch to the yearly graph view to observe historical trends and future projections.

## Future Enhancements

Future work could involve:

  - Advanced Visualizations: Implementing more complex visualizations like heatmaps or 3D models.
  - Predictive Modeling: Integrating machine learning models to enhance climate forecasting.
  - Regional Comparisons: Conducting comparative analyses between different districts or regions.
  - Impact Studies: Exploring the effects of climate change on agriculture, water resources, and local ecosystems in Nepal.
